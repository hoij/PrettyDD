#A new damage logger for Anarchy Online is in the works!
Besides being a normal damage logger this one will provide the player with
info to help her determine if a change in a particular skill has any
noticeable effect. For example, will 25 more PM/BM make me land UBT more
often or should I equip some other item in that slot.

## Some features I aim to develop
### Phase one
* Log data on:
  * All damage types.
  * Nanos casted/received (land rate etc.)
  * Hits/misses in percentage per type of damage/special etc.

### Phase two
* Throw in some statistics to show if the data is statistically significant.

### Phase three
* Write it in some readable format to a file for display inside AO.

### Phase three
* Graphs displaying damage over time.

### Phase four
* Window on top of AO displaying some info live to the player.

### Phase five
* *?*

### Phase six
* Profit
