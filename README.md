#### General
Control the program via in-game chat:

* Pause and resume logging to stop logging damage and stop the DPM/XP timer
* Reset all data parsed (this will not clear the log file)
* Display the results of a command by executing a single script (/pdd). Too see all commands available say "pdd help" to a chat channel in game and execute "/pdd".

Chose to parse the log form the beginning or the end by changing a paramater in the settings file.

## Information about the statistics

####DPM
* DPM is individual per player and calculated from the time of the first action (attack, heal, nano cast, etc.) to the time of the last action.

####Damage per Opponent and Detailed Top List ([Player], dtop)
* Regular, special, nanobot and shield percentage is calculated as percentage of total damage
* Crit, deflect and miss percentages are CatHits*

####Damage per Type (types [Player1] [Player2])
* Regular and nanobot percentages are calculated as percentage of total damage
* Crit, deflect and miss percentages are CatHits*
* A stat that isn't possible to log or doesn't exist is shown as a blank line
* Misses from regular attacks have no type info and can't be logged per type. Regular misses are instead shown as a separate type.

####Detailed Damage per Type (dtypes [Player1] [Player2])
* "Regular Total" is the sum of normal, crit and deflect damage
* "Dmg%" is calculated as percentage of total damage
* "TotHit%" (Total hit percentage) is calculated as percentage of all hits for that type
* "CatHit%" see *

\*CatHits (Category hit percentage)
* This hit rate is calculated as percentage of all hits that can crit, deflect, miss and hit normally

####XP
* Min xp gained ignores xp of value 1 (don't worry, it's still included in the total)
